# Mobile-Robotics-2022
This mobile robotics course, led by Prof. Dr. Wolfram Burgard and hosted online by UTN University, covers fundamental challenges and state-of-the-art solutions in autonomous intelligent systems.  Topics include kinematics, sensors, probabilistic modeling, robot localization, and SLAM. The course emphasizes probabilistic approaches to robot state estimation. Overall, this course provides an excellent foundation for those looking to pursue a career in mobile robotics.
Through my participation in this mobile robotics course, I gained valuable skills and knowledge in various areas such as kinematics, Bayesian inference, sensor modeling, and motion modeling. By the end of the course, I was able to understand and model the kinematics of a wheeled robot, and apply Bayesian inference to the problem of state estimation. Additionally, I learned how to model proximity sensors like LiDAR or Sonar sensors, probabilistically model the motion of a mobile robot, and apply this knowledge to estimate the position of a mobile robot given a map.

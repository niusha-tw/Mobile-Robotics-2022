Module 2 focuses on the basics of wheeled locomotion and range sensing in mobile robots. In this module, we will specifically study wheeled robots that use a differential drive as they are widely used in practice and easy to deploy. We will also explore the use of range sensors in robots for obstacle avoidance, mapping, and localization.

Through this learning unit, we will learn how to program a differential drive robot to move to a specific goal position and implement wall-following behavior in a robot using a LiDAR range sensor. We will also learn the theoretical background of locomotion with a differential drive and use the measurements of a range sensor to find the surface closest to the robot.

To successfully complete this module, we should first read and watch the provided sources to learn about differential drive and range sensing. Then, we should create a differential drive controller in the Webots simulator and use it to implement wall following as instructed in the assignment page.

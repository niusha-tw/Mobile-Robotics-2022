Module 1 provides an interdisciplinary overview of the field of mobile robotics, which encompasses engineering, artificial intelligence, control theory, cognitive science, and philosophy. The module covers various types of mobile robots, their applications, limitations, and the main hardware and software components of a mobile robot. Students are encouraged to conduct online research and are provided with reading resources to deepen their understanding of mobile robotics. The assignment requires students to find and share an online video that demonstrates an important or interesting use case of mobile robotics and to comment on other students' videos. Upon completion of this module, students should be able to describe different types of mobile robots, list their applications, identify challenges in the field of mobile robotics, and describe approaches used to address them.
